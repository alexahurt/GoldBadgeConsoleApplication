# About The Project
These are three challenges built to showcase what I have learned thus far in C#. The first challenge is an application to add and change menu items for cafe. The second challenge is a claims application for a business to view and resolve claims. Lastly, the third application is for an insurance company where certain doors are associated with certain badge numbers. This app allows a user to add a badge and eidt the doors associated with that badge.
